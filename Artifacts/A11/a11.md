## 1. Product presentation

***aurora*** is an online countryside store. The purpose is to offer a complete great-outdoors experience: Inclined ceilings, rustic-chic beams, and monochromatic exposed wood, rural land walks, outdoor hunting, and engraved limestone. All there's needed for an assured escape from contemporary modern-city life. Our main purpose is helping people relax from day-to-day activities and experience outside life with the products they need. Just in one place, our clients can purchase everything necessary to start a rural lifestyle.

***aurora*** is based on HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS. The Bootstrap framework was used to implement the user interface and when it comes to PHP, it was used the Laravel framework.

The platform has an adaptive design and a detailed navigation system by arranging the products through categories. In order to provide a reliable service, each product has a review section, which allows users to not only review the items they purchased but also to view other people's opinions. Each review includes a score and a short description, which results in the product to have an average score. Besides, users have the ability to save favorite products in a wishlist and view the history of all previous purchases.
