***aurora*** is an online countryside store. The purpose is to offer a complete great-outdoors experience: Inclined ceilings, rustic-chic beams, and monochromatic exposed wood, rural land walks, outdoor hunting, and engraved limestone. All there's needed for an assured escape from contemporary modern-city life. Our main purpose is helping people relax from day-to-day activities and experience outside life with the products they need. Just in one place, our clients can purchase everything necessary to start a rural lifestyle.

***aurora*** is based on HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS. The Bootstrap framework was used to implement the user interface and when it comes to PHP, it was used the Laravel framework.

The platform has an adaptive design and a detailed navigation system by arranging the products through categories. In order to provide a reliable service, each product has a review section, which allows users to not only review the items they purchased but also to view other people's opinions. Each review includes a score and a short description, which results in the product to have an average score. Besides, users have the ability to save favorite products in a wishlist and view the history of all previous purchases.

## 3. Application Help

The forward images show where we implemented Application Help. The purpose is to guide the user in the website on pages that may raise doubts :

We also added a link to our Frequently Asked Questions in each page, in the possibility of remaining doubts.

![Application Help in About](uploads/5ddbddb40d6e15833a9a9165ce43b078/onlinehelp_about.png)
We implemented in About because this page has a form to contact the owners and, because it's important to attend to our clients needs as fast as possible, we want to make sure they understand how it works.

![Application Help in Cart](uploads/7a1b70a50a158849223aaef34dcd8986/onlinehelp_cart.png)
We implemented in Cart to clarify any doubts that may arise regarding to shipping information, payment method or in the order review.

![Application Help in Categories](uploads/c2d6d543476a2208454f6f7205c97e5e/onlinehelp_categories.png)
We implemented in the Categories to help the user understand , if needed, how to use our abilities to filter roles and find products more quickly. 

![Application Help in Homepage](uploads/13a82e386e1bea64e700365792ff17a0/onlinehelp_homepage.png)

![Application Help in Product](uploads/8c73befddff7b445e24821a1a7023a14/onlinehelp_product.png)
We implemented in the Product page to explain, mainly, our review system and how to make a proper review. We also make a reference about the ability of search a specific product due to our color and size system.

![Application Help in Profile](uploads/bc968b000f4553af033c3eaef1649001/onlinehelp_profile.png)

The only requirement that fully diapered is Age Requirement due to our products being family-friendly.
