# A3: User Interface Prototype

***aurora*** is an online countryside store. Our main purpose is selling products so people can experience outside life and outdoor activities with the products they need. On this artifact, we will describe the interface and common features, the sitemap, storyboards, user's interface, and corresponding wireflows.

This user interfaces prototype (or horizontal prototype) has the following goals:

*  Help to identify and describe the user requirements, and raise new ones;
*  Preview and empirically test the user interface of the product to be developed;
*  Enable quick and multiple iterations on the design of the user interface.

This artefact includes three elements:

*  Overview of the interface elements and features common to all pages;
*  Overview of the information system from the viewpoint of the users (sitemap); and
* Identification and description of the main interactions with the system (at least two), organized as sequences of screens (storyboards).

The interface's descriptions are presented at the end of the document.


## 1. Interface and common features

aurora is a web application based on HTML5, JavaScript and CSS. The user interface was implemented using the Bootstrap framework.

2. Navbar
3. Content
4. Footer

In this figure some characteristics common to all the pages are highlighted:
- The web design implemented is has a responsive flow which allows the web page layout to suit most
screen sizes and resolutions, from a 17'' laptop to a 4'' smartphone.
- We opted for a fresh, clean and minimalist design to increase visual flow.
- The common links and buttons to several pages, mainly the ones placed in the navigation bar and
footer, maintain their position to deliver a consistent user experience.
- When it comes to button contrast, the most important actions have an all-green color so it stands out,
meanwhile the least important remain with a green stroke and white background.

Figure 1. Interface's guidelines

The methods behind **navigation** throughout our website ensure a clear and direct approach to what the user is looking to buy. 

**At any point** during navigation, users can search for all kinds of the stores’ products due to the search-bar being present in the website’s header.
All products are to have words associated to them in order to **cut ambiguity** in product searching.

e.g: When searching for a “black faux-fur coat”, if the user is to type “black” in the search-bar, all items matched with the word are to appear as a result.


## 2. Sitemap

A sitemap is a visual representation of the relationship between the different pages of a website that shows how all the information fits together.

The sitemap gives the project team an idea of how the website is going to be built by helping to clarify the information hierarchy. [Brown10](Dan Brown, Communicating Design, Peachpit Press, 2nd Edition, 2010, ISBN: 978-0-321-71246-2).

## 3. Storyboards

Storyboards are presented to represent some of the main interactions with the system using a sequence of interfaces and explaining how navigation is done between them.

<br/>

This storyboard represents the user accessing the About page where he can find information regarding the website and its owners. It also represents the user accessing to the Frequently Asked Questions page, where the user can find the most common questions asked.
