# A8: Vertical prototype

***aurora*** is an online countryside store. Our main purpose is selling products so people can experience outside life and outdoor activities with the products they need.

The Vertical Prototype includes the implementation of user stories and aims to validate the architecture presented, also serving to gain familiarity with the technologies used in the project.

The implementation is based on the [LBAW skeleton](https://git.fe.up.pt/lbaw/template-lbaw) and include work on all layers of the architecture of the solution to implement: user interface, business logic and data access. The prototype includes the implementation of pages of visualization, insertion, edition and removal of information; the control of permissions in the access to the implemented pages; and a presentation of error and success messages.
